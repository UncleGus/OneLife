Lifespan mod

This mod pulls hardcoded age values out to parameters for easy configuration.

Server settings are:
babyAge: the age up until which a player is considered a baby
fertileAge: the age at which a player can have a baby
minPickupBabyAge: the age at which a player can pick up a baby
fullSpeedAge: the age at which a player can move at full speed
matureAge: the age at which a player is a mature adult
oldAge: the age at which players start aging
forceDeathAge: the age when players die

Client settings are:
babyAge: the age up until which a player is considered a baby
matureAge: the age at which a player is a mature adult
oldAge: the age at which players start aging
forceDeathAge: the age when players die

The client settings are mostly cosmetic, but may also have some effect on the
messages sent to the server. The server will reject any that do not match its
expectations, so the client settings should be kept in line with the server's.
