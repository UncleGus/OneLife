Temperatue mod

The function to recalculate a player's heat is normally executed when the server is sending
an update about the player, i.e. when they have finished moving or performing some action.
This mod shifts that calculation to a half-second timer instead.

It also changes how the clothing insulation works. Instead of using it in the heat
calculation itself, it now calculates the heat independently, then adjusts the player's
heat towards the new target based on the clothing insulation.
