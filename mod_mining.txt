Mining mod

This mod adds a new cached database of underground ores. These ores are defined in the
object data. There is a new Ore checkbox in the editor, which saves ore={0|1} after
mapChance. Any object marked as an ore will use the mapChance value as a scalar for
the size of the vein. If it is not meant to spawn above ground, remove all biome
values.

Underground objects can be used in transitions but these transitions will only be
checked for when a player is using an object on bare ground. If a transition does exist
involving the underground object, the underground map will be cleared at that location.
